# Hardware selection

filtering-rule is floating, thus make time-consuming decision practice enjoyable.

## hints

1. carry on **primary-school grade** calculation, **do it by yourself**

* **Jeff Dean - Latency Numbers Every Programmer Should Know**
* [jboner/latency.txt](https://gist.github.com/jboner/2841832)

2. de-mythfy anything sound like **magic**
there is no magic. everything is real. be realistic.

## rules

### 1. no server components
don't touch **any** second-hand server components stuff, as your time and life-span matters more than these electronic stuff, just let those freaking C/P value die gentle

* [Failure Curve](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/failure-curve-for-software-in-software-engineering/)

### 2. no test-user 
don't touch **any** bleeding-edge components, unless you want to make it an entrance to industry-sector.
* to make a choice on a career-track or be chosen by other people's career. it is a more critical topic...

### 2.1 avoid weired stuff
quantity really matters. any product within small volume is not a choice for end-user. don't be an **performance artist**, just stay in real world.

### [lured-to-have-a-try]2.5 no lifetime ownership (if you strongly eager to be a `tester`)
if you still want to do so, don't touch **any** product can't be recycled (brought again by another fever guy) after **one year**. as this is the last chance you can make as much as 50% of the money back other than.

### 3. [optional] budget oriented
don't touch **any** products, unless you sure there are a bulk amount of shipment, as your money and capital matters more than the **delivered physical** from capital giants.

at least, when depreciation is a nature, **The less you pay, the less you lose**

essentially, you always pay your own time to do anything!

## hardware requirement and standard

**hardware**
* modern stage CPU (bluntly determined by `CPU-z benchmark 17.01.64`, while **SP>350 and MP>2000** )
* adequate memory (minimal **16GB**, otherwise no workstation but still PC-grade)
* middle-level storage ( **1 TB** is a must )
* GPU?/ Matrix Calculation accelerator, if necessary (integrated iGPU is enough for office job)
